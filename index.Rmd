The Ploidyverse is an integrated collection of R packages for the analysis
of mixed-ploidy genetic data.

The `ploidyverse` package is the main R package responsible for installing
and managing all other packages in the Ploidyverse. It can be installed from
GitHub using the `devtools`, as demonstrated below:

```r
# Install devtools if you don't already have it
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install and load the ploidyverse package
devtools::install_github("ploidyverse/ploidyverse")
library(ploidyverse)
```
